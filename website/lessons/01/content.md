# 1. Why? The prototype, then refactor problem

## Motivation

Introduction to the problem: Developing projects in single notebooks cause a lot of trouble. They are hard to maintain, test and review. However, if we follow some best practices, and with the help of some open-source tools, we can implement a workflow that allows us to go from Jupyter to production instantly.

* Something you've heard many times: notebooks are only for prototyping, you must move to python scripts for production
* This course will demonstrate that you can use notebooks for production work and that's actually more productive

* We'll walk through a mix of best practices and tools

Fun fact: this course is being entirely developed from Jupyter!
